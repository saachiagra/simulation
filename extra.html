        <h2>Extra Information</h2>
        <p>This section is an amalgamation of simulation explanations, write-ups I removed from the main site, additional rabbit holes (you 
        can never have too many rabbit holes!), and additional website links that I drew some inspiration from 
        but didn't directly cite in the article. Enjoy!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Simulation Explanations</h2>
        <h3 id="tempDiff">Temperature Differences</h3>
        <p>Source <a href="#s21">(21)</a> has interesting information about different variables can influence data results.
        The paper said that the "degree of change" caused by different thermometers and their locative relative to sunlight/shade 
        "varies from country to country and there is no simple way to quantify the magnitude of any effect." Source <a href="#s21">(21)</a> and 
        <a href="#s22">(22)</a> both say that the heat island effect hasn't drastically changed overall temperature data, justifying this by
        saying "urban areas are only 0.5% of the land area". Source <a href="#s23">(23)</a> had some ranges for the difference in temperatures 
        between urban and rural areas (1-7&deg;F).</p>
        <h3 id="gases">Heat-Trapping Gases</h3>
        <p>Some gases are better at trapping heat than others. Source <a href="#s24">(24)</a> has the global warming potentials 
        of different gases, which compares how well a gas can trap heat compared to carbon dioxide (which has a GWP of 1).
        I *tried* to reflect this difference by having the differences in area correspond to the differences in GWPs, 
        but I had to make the radii much smaller (making the circle area smaller) so that the molecules would fit within the alloted simulation space.</p>
        <h3 id="isotope">Carbon Isotopes</h3>
        <p>I had to make the concentration of C-14 higher for ~educational purposes~. The ratio between
        C-12 and C-13 (989:11) is accurate for the atmosphere, but for plants the ratio is 991:9 rather than 994:6. Source <a href="#s25">(25)</a> 
        has the delta value for plants, and Source <a href="#s26">(26)</a> has a delta-to-percentage converter formula and atmospheric carbon isotope
        concentrations.</p>
        <h2>Additional Write-Ups</h2>
        <h3 id="histTemp">History of Temperature</h3>
        <p>The history of measuring fluctuations in temperature goes all the way back to 1610, 
        when Galileo made a thermoscope using a glass sphere containing alcohols each with different densities <a href="#s3">(3)</a>. 
        The alcohols would rise and fall within the container based on the ambient temperature, 
        but this device didn’t have any markings to determine the exact temperature, hence why it’s not 
        considered a “thermometer” <a href="#s3">(3)</a>. In 1612, Santorio Santorio made a thermoscope calibrated to measure 
        human temperature, and in 1654, Ferdinand II de’ Medici made a thermometer “to depend on the expansion 
        and contraction of a liquid, which was independent of barometric pressure” <a href="#s3">(3)</a>. </p>
        <p>The first set of continuous temperature readings from thermometers comes from the 
        Central England Temperature Data Series, which started in 1659 <a href="#s4">(4)</a>. Though, we don’t have 
        substantial data <span id = "rb1">&#128007;</span> on global temperatures before the 1880s. </p>
        <div id="rabbitHole1">We may not have adequate thermometer readings from before, but there are other methods scientists use to calculate premodern temperatures!
        <br>Tree rings: <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2540/tree-rings-provide-snapshots-of-earths-past-climate/" target="_blank">&#128007;</a>
        <br>Pollen: <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/how-can-pollen-teach-us-about-climate" target="_blank">&#128007;</a></div>
        
        <h3 id="c14Decay">C-14 Radioactive Decay</h3>
        <p>C-14 can turn into a N-14 atom through the process of beta minus decay. Essentially, a neutron within the carbon atom transforms into a proton, releasing 
        an electron and an antineutrino in the process <a href="#s5">(5)</a>.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>
            <p>Special thanks to Mr. Neno December for encouraging me to make my ideas come to life,
            compelling me to think about climate change through a different lens, and assisting me with initial website testing and information compilations.
            I honestly couldn't have made this website without your help.</p>
            <p>Thank you to Ashley Feng, Mr. Gaurav Johari, Saffron Liu, Dr. Kelly Mendiola, Abhinav Rachakonda, Mr. James Shockey, and Mrs. Priyanka Uppal for beta-testing
            the website, providing me with valuable feedback on the website's functionality &amp; content, and
            giving incredible moral support for this project I've taken on. Y'all are amazing, and I'm so grateful for all of your help :)</p>
            <p>Last, but *definitely* not least, thank you (yes, YOU!) for taking the time to read &amp; interact with this website! Words aren't 
            enough to describe my gratitude, but just know it's there in my heart.</p>
            <!-- <p>Hopefully, this walkthrough helped to solidify your understanding of 
            the complex phenomenon that is climate change and also pique your interest in this area! I, 
            unfortunately, didn’t cover everything related to this topic, and really, this walkthrough 
            should be a starting point for more exploration. Throughout the page, I’ve included some sources 
            for topics that interested me while making this site, but feel free to investigate on your own! <br>
            The world, currently suffering from climate change, is your oyster.</p> -->

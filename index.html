      <p>Natural disasters have always been a part of weather phenomena, but lately,
      the number and severity of these events seemed to have increased tremendously.
      But wait, before you cite the two c-words as the source of this calamity,
      let’s step back…</p>

      <p>Now, onto discussing the weather!</p>


    <h2>Weather</h2>
      <p>Weather, defined by the National Centers for Environmental Information,
      is the “mix of events that happen each day in our atmosphere” <a href="#s1">(1)</a>. 
      Weather can change within mere minutes and includes phenomena like rain, wind, and snow. 
      A single instance of a natural disaster would fall under the weather category. </p>
      <p>But it seems like we’ve had more of these storms recently, right? 
      The term “weather” is used to describe what happens in a given instance, 
      not justify long-term trends…</p>
    
    <h2>Climate</h2>
      <p>Climate is “what the weather is like over a long period of time in a specific area” <a href="#s1">(1)</a>. 
      So the weather that an area usually experiences is considered the climate of that location. </p>
      <p>In order to determine the climate characteristics of a region, 
      scientists take measurements of different variables such as temperature, 
      precipitation, wind, cloud cover, humidity, and even aerosols over a period of time <a href="#s2">(2)</a>. 
      There is a such thing as global climate: the average weather conditions for the entire planet 
      over a certain period of time <a href="#s1">(1)</a>. </p>
      <p>Although there are more nuances to how these variables are used for calculations, 
      typically averages are used. For example, rainfall records are taken over a year 
      to calculate the annual precipitation levels of an area, which characterizes the 
      climate based on how dry or wet the region is. </p>
      <p>Let’s focus on the variable temperature for some demonstrations. </p>
    
    <h2>Temperature</h2>
      <p>Below is a graph for the average global temperature from 1850 to 2023 <a href="#s20">(20)</a>. 
      This data consists of average temperature readings taken during the month of June, 
      and all the data points are in &deg;C. </p>
      
      <canvas id="tempSim"></canvas>
      <!--ABOVE FORMATTING IS: style="width:70%;max-width:1000px;"-->
      <script src="js/tempSim.js"></script>

      <!--<img src="img/comingsoon.jpg" alt="more features and info coming soon!!" width="400px">-->

      <p>Let’s analyze the overarching trend of the graph. It looks like the temperature is generally
      increasing as time progresses, and we see a steady uptick in temperatures starting from 
      about the 1980s. </p>
      <p>However, there’s an important question that should be asked: 
      how was the temperature data collected in the first place? <span id = "rb1">&#128007;</span></p>
      <div id="rabbitHole1">Read a short history of temperature data collection in the "Extra Information" section!
      <a href="extra.html#histTemp" target="_blank">&#128007;</a></div>
      <p>Before digitalized thermometers, scientists typically used thermometers that contained some liquid
      -- often mercury -- within glass <a href="#s15">(15)</a>. However, there were other types of thermometers, such as
      thermistors<span id = "rb2">&#128007;</span>, 
      that scientists used for weather reports <a href="#s15">(15)</a>. Although liquid thermometers and
      thermistors would both theoretically measure the same temperature, they both do so using different
      processes, so there’s a valid question on how temperature data can be affected by this variation.</p>
      <div id="rabbitHole2">More information about thermistors (might be interesting 
      if you've taken an electronics or physics class): <a href="https://www.teamwavelength.com/thermistor-basics/" target="_blank">&#128007;</a></div>
      <p>There are also different processes and methodologies that were used to collect temperature data. 
      Some thermometers were contained in Cotton Region Shelters, little wooden boxes that would shade the 
      device <a href="#s15">(15)</a>. Other thermometers were exposed to direct sunlight. Different weather stations also 
      collected their data at different times of the day while others used a maximum-minimum temperature 
      system <a href="#s15">(15)</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s also the heat island effect or the urban heat island, where urbanized areas are warmer 
      than surrounding rural areas <a href="#s16">(16)</a>. Again, a weather station located in the heart of a bustling city 
      and another station a few dozen miles away from the metropole can produce different data sets for the 
      atmospheric temperature.</p>
      <p>All these little variations -- thermometer type, collection processes, thermometer locations, 
      and heat island effects -- can drastically affect the final temperature data, which in turn can 
      affect climate models. Below is a simulation to demonstrate these fluctuations: <a href="#s21">(21)</a><a href="#s22">(22)</a><a href="#s23">(23)</a></p>

    </div>
    
    <p>So it looks like temperature data can get skewed by the type of thermometer used and the location 
    of the device in relation to sunlight and urban spaces. </p>
    <div id="rabbitHole3">This is the same link as the citation, but this article explains the standardizing process
    in a simple, easy-to-read manner (highly recommend checking it out)! <a href="https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/climate-data-primer/how-do-weather-observations-become-climate-data" target="_blank">&#128007;</a></div>
    <p>However, scientists have accounted for these variations after collecting weather station data and 
    before making climate modules. This consideration can involve combing through data to find 
    inconsistencies, such as unnatural spikes in temperature readings, or creating algorithms to smooth 
    out data points <a href="#s17">(17)</a><a href="#s18">(18)</a><span id = "rb3">&#128007;</span>. 
    The math behind these standardizations <span id = "rb4">&#128007;</span> is pretty complex, but the overall 
    process is strategically minimizing any abnormal variations that have arisen from data collection 
    methods to ensure the data accurately portrays a region’s characteristics. Below is a very simple demonstration of how 
    scientists standardize data sets: a linear regression, which uses a best-fit line to approximate the trend of discrete data points. </p>
    <div id="rabbitHole4">This link has some information about standardizing. If you click on the yellow 
    binoculars icon, you can explore the several interactive graphs the EPA has created! <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-temperature" target="_blank">&#128007;</a></div>

    <p>Let’s look at the graph again <a href="#s20">(20)</a>.</p>
    <canvas id="tempSim2"></canvas>
    <script src="js/tempSim2.js"></script>
    <p>You should notice that some of the data entries are negative and some are positive, and all 
    the points range from -1 &deg;C to 1.5 &deg;C. This is because these data points are measuring 
    anomalies from a standard formed from the average temperature over the 20th century, 1901 to 2000. 
    The temperature in June for a given year is compared with this standard, and the change is plotted 
    on the above chart. </p>
    <p>This is a lot of averages to keep track of! But these averages help to further remove statistical 
    anomalies that can give scientists skewed data. For example, perhaps June 1909 happened to be a 
    particularly cooler summer and might be considered an anomaly. But by looking at the years preceding 
    and succeeding 1909, we can see that the early 1900s were typically cooler than the present day. </p>
    <p>Though after all these adjustments, there still seems to be a steady increase in temperatures by around 1&deg;C. 
    So what could be causing this uptick?</p>
  
  <h2>Gases</h2>
    <p>One cause of temperature changes is based on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. There are 
    certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, that effectively traps heat within the surface 
    and lower atmospheric levels. Below demonstrates that trapping: <a href="#s24">(24)</a></p>

    <div id="rabbitHoleC">Why the radii of the gases are different: <a href="extra.html#gases" target="_blank">&#128007;</a>
    </div>
    
    <p>As you may already know, scientists use the term “greenhouse gases” to categorize them due to their 
    heat-trapping characteristics like a greenhouse. It seems like these gases have the potential to warm 
    up the atmosphere, but are they actually causing the rising temperature trend we’re experiencing? </p>
    <p>Well to determine this, scientists have gathered past samples of air from drilling into ice cores. 
    When ice freezes, little air pockets that contain the chemical composition of the atmosphere at the 
    time get trapped within. Over several thousands of years, different layers of ice form, where each 
    level corresponds to different time periods. Scientists drill and extract huge ice cores, and 
    carefully taking air samples from a layer allows scientists to determine the atmospheric composition 
    of a long time ago. In fact, air samples from 800 thousand years ago have been recovered!</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="img/icecoreCO2.png" alt="graph, shows co2 levels oscillating between 170 and 250 ppm, but 
      modern data shows a huge uptick in co2 levels, reaching over 400 ppm today">
      <figcaption>Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in parts per million (ppm) for the past 800,000 years 
      based on ice-core data (light purple line) compared to 2022 concentration (bright purple dot). 
      The peaks and valleys in the line show ice ages (low CO2) and warmer interglacials (higher CO2). 
      Throughout that time, CO2 was never higher than 300 ppm (light purple dot, between 300,000 and 
      400,000 years ago). The increase over the last 60 years is 100 times faster than previous natural 
      increases. In fact, on the geologic time scale, the increase from the end of the last ice age to the 
      present (dashed purple line) looks virtually instantaneous. Graph by NOAA Climate.gov based on data 
      from Lüthi, et al., 2008, via NOAA NCEI Paleoclimatology Program.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>So there has been an increase in these types of gases in recent years, but what exactly is 
    their source? After all, the Earth has massive carbon sinks, several organisms produce carbon 
    dioxide through cellular respiration, and CO2 is naturally released through volcanic eruptions 
    and forest fires <a href="#s19">(19)</a>.</p>
    <p>Before we answer that question, let’s just talk about carbon dioxide, specifically the 
    structure of carbon atoms. All carbon atoms have 6 protons (that’s what makes them a carbon atom!) 
    but can have differing numbers of neutrons. Atoms that have the same number of protons but vary 
    in their neutron count are called isotopes. Most carbon atoms have 6 neutrons, but others can have 
    7 or even 8 neutrons, and these are all considered different isotopes of carbon. Carbon atoms with 
    6 neutrons are abbreviated as C-12, and carbon atoms with 7 or 8 neutrons are abbreviated as C-13 or C-14, 
    respectively. C-12 is the lightest isotope while C-14 is the heaviest. While the other two isotopes are 
    stable, C-14 is radioactive <a href="#s6">(6)</a>. This means that over time, C-14 will turn into N-14 (a nitrogen atom 
    with 7 neutrons). <span id = "rb6">&#128007;</span> </p>
    <div id="rabbitHole6">Read some more about C-14 radioactive decay in the "Extra Information" section! (this stuff is cool)
    <a href="extra.html#c14Decay" target="_blank">&#128007;</a></div>
    <p>Although C-12 is definitely the most abundant compared to its larger isotope counterparts, the concentrations of 
    C-12 compared to C-13 and C-14 vary within different materials and organisms. Below is a simulation that helps
    demonstrate the slight ratio discrepancies within some compounds: <a href="#s25">(25)</a><a href="#s26">(26)</a></p>

    </section>
    <div id="rabbitHoleB"> Where the carbon isotope percentages came from: <a href="extra.html#isotope" target="_blank">&#128007;</a>
    </div>

    <p>Although we see rising CO2 levels in terms of ppm, the concentration of measured C-14 has actually 
    been decreasing over the past decade or so <a href="#s10">(10)</a>. Air samples from the terrestrial biosphere, ocean, 
    and general atmosphere -- which are all considered carbon sinks -- have similar C-14 concentration values, 
    so carbon released from these sources won’t affect the ratio of C-14 within the air 
    <span id = "rb5">&#128007;</span> <a href="#s9">(9)</a><a href="#s10">(10)</a>. </p>
    <div id="rabbitHole5">To calculate the ratio between different isotopes within a sample, 
    scientists use delta values: <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/isotopes/deltavalues.html" target="_blank">&#128007;</a></div>
    <p>However, we do know that fossil fuels don’t have C-14 because any C-14 atom within the original ancient 
    plant would have decayed by the present day <a href="#s8">(8)</a>. So burning fossil fuels, which contain a significant 
    concentration of C-12, is changing the composition of the atmosphere!</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>These scientific phenomena make sense because the 1760s was the advent of the Industrial Revolution. During this era, 
    coal was used to power steam engines and make steel through a process of smelting coal with iron <a href="#s12">(12)</a>. 
    Coal is considered a fossil fuel because it’s produced from “the remains of dead plants and animals” within 
    the Earth’s crust <a href="#s12">(12)</a>. </p>
    <p>The Industrial Revolution began in Britain and later came to other now-first-world countries such 
    as the US. This era revolutionized people’s lives through the number of new developments people now 
    had access to, including forms of transportation and electricity. Subsequently, the demand and usage 
    for fossil fuels dramatically increased around the 1950s <span id = "rb7">&#128007;</span> 
    due to more people purchasing cars, using electricity, and manufacturing steel products <a href="#s13">(13)</a>. 
    Ever since, we across the globe have still been mostly using fossil fuels to power our homes, cars, and our lifestyles.</p>
    <div id="rabbitHole7">I haven't been able to find something as of now, but I wonder if there's 
    a link between the decolonization of Africa &amp; Asia and this uptick in fossil fuel consumption around the 1950s.
    <br>If you find something, please let me know!</div>
    <figure>
      <img src="img/fossilfuels&temps.svg" alt="a graph depicting different temperature-increasing phenomenon and 
      an increase of global temperatures" width="70%" max-width="700px">
      <figcaption>By <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?" title="User:Efbrazil&action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Efbrazil (page does not exist)">Efbrazil</a> - <span class="int-own-work" lang="en">Own work</span>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=113363595">Link</a></caption>
    </figure>
    <p>As we can see, an increase in fossil fuel consumption corresponds well with an uptick in global
     temperatures!</p>
    <p>Although we don’t depend as heavily on coal nowadays compared to the mid-1900s, other energy sources 
    like natural gas also release greenhouse gas emissions, increasing atmospheric gas concentrations. </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Okay, let’s recap all this information. Beginning in the Industrial Revolution, coal started to 
    be used as fuel for machines, and burning coal released byproducts such as CO2. CO2 is a greenhouse 
    gas that can trap heat within the atmosphere, leading to rising global temperatures on average. Other 
    fuel sources like natural gas can contribute more to rising emissions. Scientists have used extensive 
    weather station samples, statistical analyses, other data collection methods, and computational models 
    to arrive at this conclusion. </p>
    <p>So temperatures on average may be rising globally, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that all areas 
    have had increased temperatures. This is true because temperature changes affect regions differently 
    based on factors such as latitude, biome, and altitude. In fact, this is the reason why scientists have 
    moved away from using the term “Global Warming” and are instead opting to use “Climate Change” to 
    describe what’s happening; climate change encompasses more of the effects and outcomes that can arise 
    from greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
    <p>You, in your life, have likely been experiencing these effects. Please, take a moment to reflect 
    on the abnormal weather conditions you’ve witnessed and think back to general climate change trends. 
    There is a well-established causational relationship between anthropogenic-released greenhouse gases 
    and the natural disasters happening every day. The way society is currently operating directly harms 
    the planet we all live on, and there are only dire consequences if we keep continuing these practices. 
    Natural disasters will only become more harsh and extreme, putting more people in danger and at risk 
    for calamities.</p>
    <p>So…now what? Is there anything realistic that we can do to solve this problem?</p>

      <p>Special thanks to Mr. Neno December for encouraging me to make my ideas come to life,
      forcing me to think about climate change in a different lens, and assisting me with initial website testing and information compilations.
      It's a cliche, but I truly couldn't have made this website without your help.</p>
      <p>Thank you to Ashley Feng, Mr. Gaurav Johari, Saffron Liu, Dr. Kelly Mendiola, Abhinav Rachakonda, Mr. James Shockey, and Mrs. Priyanka Uppal for beta-testing
      the website, providing me with valuable feedback on the website's functionality &amp; content, and
      giving incredible moral support for this project I've taken on. Y'all are amazing, and I'm so grateful for all of your help :)</p>
      <p>Thanks to my parents for being forced to listen to my lengthy ramblings about climate change &amp; coding bugs as well as for looking 
      over parts of the website I had just finished, even when you both probably had better things to do. 
      I would apologize for being annoying, but we all would know that I'm lying ;)</p>
      <p>Last, but *definitely* not least, thank you (yes, YOU!) for taking the time to read &amp; interact with this website! Words aren't 
      enough to describe my gratitude, but just know it's there in my heart.</p>
      <!-- <p>Hopefully, this walkthrough helped to solidify your understanding of 
      the complex phenomenon that is climate change and also pique your interest in this area! I, 
      unfortunately, didn’t cover everything related to this topic, and really, this walkthrough 
      should be a starting point for more exploration. Throughout the page, I’ve included some sources 
      for topics that interested me while making this site, but feel free to investigate on your own! <br>
      The world, currently suffering from climate change, is your oyster.</p> -->

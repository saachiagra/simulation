    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <!--TODO: put images here-->
      <p>Blazing flames making their way through dense shrubbery with no regard for the beings within the area. 
      Blizzards that steal any potential source of warmth and destroy systems that millions of people rely on. 
      Relentless heat waves which make you think you’re about to melt onto the sidewalk. 
      Rapid floods that seep into homes and fill up the basement with sewage water. </p>
    
      <p>Natural disasters have always been a part of weather phenomena, but lately,
      the number and severity of these events seemed to have increased tremendously.
      But wait, before you cite the two c-words as the source of this calamity,
      let’s step back and talk about weather. </p>

    <h2>Weather</h2>
      <p>Weather, defined by the National Centers for Environmental Information,
      is the “mix of events that happen each day in our atmosphere” (1). 
      Weather can change within mere minutes and includes phenomena like rain, wind, and snow. 
      A single instance of a natural disaster would fall under the weather category. </p>
      <p>But it seems like we’ve had more of these storms recently, right? 
      The term “weather” is used to describe what happens in a given instance, 
      not justify long-term trends…</p>
    
    <h2>Climate</h2>
      <p>Climate is “what the weather is like over a long period of time in a specific area” (1). 
      So the weather that an area usually experiences is considered the climate of that location. </p>
      <p>In order to determine the climate characteristics of a region, 
      scientists take measurements of different variables such as temperature, 
      precipitation, wind, cloud cover, humidity, and even aerosols over a period of time (2). 
      There is a such thing as global climate: the average weather conditions for the entire planet 
      over a certain period of time (1). </p>
      <p>Although there are more nuances to how these variables are used for calculations, 
      typically averages are used. For example, rainfall records are taken over a year 
      to calculate the annual precipitation levels of an area, which characterizes the 
      climate based on how dry or wet the region is. </p>
      <p>Let’s use the variable temperature for some demonstrations. </p>
    
    <h2>Temperature</h2>
      <p>Below is a graph for the average global temperature from 1850 to 2023. 
      This data consists of average temperature readings taken during the month of June, 
      and all the data points are in &deg;C. </p>

      <p>Let’s analyze the overarching trend of the graph. It looks like the temperature is generally
      increasing as time progresses, and we see a steady uptick in temperatures starting from 
      about the 1980s. </p>
      <p>However, there’s an important question that should be asked: 
      how was the temperature data collected in the first place?</p>
      <p>The history of measuring fluctuations in temperature goes all the way back to 1610, 
      when Galileo made a thermoscope using a glass sphere containing alcohols each with different densities (3). 
      The alcohols would rise and fall within the container based on the ambient temperature, 
      but this device didn’t have any markings to determine the exact temperature, hence why it’s not 
      considered a “thermometer” (3). In 1612, Santorio Santorio made a thermoscope calibrated to measure 
      human temperature, and in 1654, Ferdinand II de’ Medici made a thermometer “to depend on the expansion 
      and contraction of a liquid, which was independent of barometric pressure” (3). </p>
      <p>The first set of continuous temperature readings from thermometers comes from the 
      Central England Temperature Data Series, which started in 1659 (4). Though, we don’t have 
      substantial data on global temperatures before the 1880s. </p>

This [website](https://saachiagra.github.io/simulation/) is intended to be a walk-through of understanding exactly how and why climate change is happening.

The subject "climate change" has been a greatly contested issue for the past few decades, and people have taken sides to where they stand on the topic.
People have all sorts of beliefs, which can be influenced by the media and what we see around in our day-to-day lives.

Of course, there's a lot of scientific research done on climate change, but several of those papers are blocked by paywalls and jargon that the average reader cannont understand.
But also, how can we be sure that those experiments or models accurately depict our world?

Skeptics of climate change have some valid questions about the conclusions made by climate scientists, which are often dismissed by strong believers.
It may be easy to say, "Pssh, the evidence is right *there*, how could anyone not believe in this?" 

But if we want to solve this problem as a society, we need to address those concerns people have. Belittling their beliefs does nothing to bring both sides to the same opinion.
And if we want actual, concrete change to happen, we need to **listen** to them and genuinely **consider** their viewpoint. 
Only after understanding their side can we address any misconceptions they may have. 

The end product, by no means, will be perfect in any way, but I'm hoping that this website can make people think a bit more about how we gather and intrepret information.

Right now, this website is a ***work-in-progress***! Nothing should seem cohesive yet, rather everything should be pretty chaotic.
I'm currently aiming to work on the content and little interactive portions first and later make the website not look like an eyesore.
(i also don't really know what im doing but shhhh im trying to figure things out)

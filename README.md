This [website](https://saachiagra.github.io/simulation/), simply put, is a walkthrough on why climate change is happening.

The subject "climate change" has been a contested issue for the past few decades, and 
people have taken sides to where they stand. People have all sorts of beliefs, which the 
media and what we see around us can influence.

Of course, there's a lot of scientific research on climate change, but several papers are 
blocked by paywalls and jargon that the average reader cannot comprehend easily. So it
can be difficult for the general public to understand if those experiments or 
models accurately depict our world.

Skeptics of climate change have some valid questions, which are often dismissed by strong 
believers, about the conclusions made by climate scientists. It may be easy to say, "Pssh, 
the evidence is right there, how could anyone not believe in this?" But if we want to solve 
this problem as a society, we need to address those concerns people have. Belittling their 
beliefs does nothing to bring both sides to the same opinion. And if we want actual, concrete 
change to happen, we need to **listen** to them and genuinely **consider** their viewpoint. 
Only after understanding their side can we address any misconceptions they may have.

I hope that this website makes people (and hopefully you as well!) think more about how we 
gather and interpret information.

Right now, this website is a ***work-in-progress***! 
I've have all the content laid out (though there's always more I could write about), and I'm currently aiming to make the website look better in the near future.
